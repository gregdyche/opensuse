# opensuse
running openSUSE on my desktops

I want to experiment with github and run openSUSE natively on my old macbook. I thought I'd keep the notes here. Let me know if you have any ideas.

thanks, Greg

PS I'll try to dual boot my 2015 macbook instead. The old 2010 macbook was too risk to go native because of a lack of ethernet card.
