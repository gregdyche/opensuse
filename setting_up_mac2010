  latest release, openSUSE Leap 15.1 as of 6/19/20 
  
  Hardward requirements:
    1.6Ghz chip is min, and my old macbook is 1.4. This might not work, but I'm going forward

    Not sure what SDB stands for?
    Mactel? assuming that's an intel chip macbook.
    
    openSUSE Leap 42.3 and 15.0 overwrite the default EFI boot manager, leaving impossible to load MacOS. 
    Therefore it is necessary to install rEFInd after installing Linux.
    
    Asked to shrink disk0s2 to 60GB to make room for linux. The disk drive is only 56GB to begin with, so
    I'm deciding to overwrite macOS completly. This will eliminate device driver updates. I'm guessing apple isn't updating
    a macbook from 2010 anyway.
    
 
 
 Beginning to think this macbook might be too old, too small, and too slow. I can still use it as a youtube player, and
 I might leave it alone.
